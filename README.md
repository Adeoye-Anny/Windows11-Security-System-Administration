# Windows 11 Security, Office 365 Support, Zoom Troubleshooting, and AnyDesk Remote Assistance
### Windows 11 Security & System Administration Hands-On Lab
### Project Overview
In this lab, I performed hands-on system administration and security testing on a Windows 11 environment. The objective was to demonstrate practical skills in user account management, system updates, basic troubleshooting, and endpoint security using Microsoft Defender. This lab simulates real-world IT Support and Help Desk responsibilities.

### Lab Environment
Operating System: Windows 11 Enterprise
Environment Type: Local machine / Virtual Machine
Security Tool: Microsoft Defender Antivirus

### User Account Management
I created and managed local user accounts to simulate standard user and administrator access. This helps enforce least-privilege principles commonly used in enterprise environments.

### Actions Performed
* Opened Computer Management → Local Users and Groups.
* Created a new standard user account.
* Modified account properties including password settings.
* Verified login access by signing in with the new user account.

### Windows Update Management
I checked and applied Windows updates to ensure the system was fully patched. This reduces security vulnerabilities and improves system stability.

### Steps Taken
* Navigated to Settings → Windows Update.
* Checked for available updates.
* Downloaded and installed pending updates.
* Restarted the system to complete installation.

### System Error Troubleshooting
I simulated basic troubleshooting scenarios by reviewing system error messages and logs.

#### Troubleshooting Actions
* Checked Event Viewer for system and application errors.
* Identified warning and error logs related to system performance.
* Verified that no critical unresolved issues were present after updates.

### Microsoft Defender Antivirus Testing
To validate endpoint protection, I tested Microsoft Defender using the industry-standard EICAR test file, which safely simulates malware detection without causing harm.

### Testing Process
* Verified Microsoft Defender was enabled and up to date.
* Downloaded the EICAR test string from a trusted source.
* Attempted to save the file to the system.
* Observed Microsoft Defender automatically detect and quarantine the file.
* Reviewed threat details and protection history.

### Security Outcome
* Microsoft Defender successfully detected and blocked the simulated threat.
* Real-time protection and alerting were confirmed to be working correctly.
* The system remained secure with no manual intervention required.

### Skills Demonstrated
* Windows 11 system administration
* Local user account management
* OS update and patch management
* Basic troubleshooting using Event Viewer
* Endpoint security validation with Microsoft Defender

### Conclusion
This lab demonstrates my practical understanding of Windows 11 administration and endpoint security. The ability to manage users, maintain system updates, troubleshoot issues, and validate antivirus protection reflects real-world IT Support and Help Desk responsibilities in a corporate environment.
